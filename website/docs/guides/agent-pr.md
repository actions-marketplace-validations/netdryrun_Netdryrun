# AI agents without Docker: the pull-request path

The [MCP server](../ai-agents.md) needs Docker and containerlab on the machine the agent runs on. Many coding agents run in a sandbox without them. They can still get a verdict: they push their change to a branch and open a pull request, the [GitHub Action](../github-action.md) runs the lab on a GitHub runner, and the agent reads the result. This page is that flow, from 0.3.3.

## 1. The workflow in the network repository

```yaml
# .github/workflows/netdryrun.yml
name: Netdryrun
on: pull_request
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write      # for the comment
jobs:
  verdict:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: netdryrun/netdryrun@v0.3.3
        with:
          path: network/        # the folder with netdryrun.yml
          pr-comment: true
```

The job fails on anything but a pass, so branch protection can require it. A pull request from a fork can't be commented on (GitHub gives fork runs a read-only token); the verdict is still in the job result and the artifact.

## 2. What the agent reads

**The comment.** The Action posts one comment per lab (per `path:`) and updates it on every push. Its first lines have a fixed format:

```text
<!-- netdryrun-comment network/ -->
<!-- netdryrun-verdict: {"schema": "netdryrun.mcp-result/v1", "status": "failed", "verdict": "DO NOT APPLY THIS CHANGE", "passed": 5, "failed": 1, "commit": "4f2a9c1e0b7d3a5f6e8c9b1a2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e"} -->
**Netdryrun: DO NOT APPLY THIS CHANGE** · status `failed` · 5 passed, 1 failed · commit `4f2a9c1e0b7d`
```

Read the JSON on the second line and decide on `status`, with three rules:

- **Only comments by `github-actions[bot]`** (or the account you set as `comment-author`). Anyone can post a comment that looks like this one.
- **Only a header whose `commit` is the pull request's head commit.** A header with an older commit is from an earlier push: wait for the new run. A run that wrote no report still rewrites the header, as `error`.
- **Every Netdryrun comment on the pull request must say `passed`**, one per lab.

The rest of the comment is the human summary: failed checks first, with their evidence.

**The artifact.** For the full detail, the job uploads `netdryrun-verdict.json` with the reports (artifact `netdryrun-report`). It is the same object the MCP tools return: `status`, the frozen `verdict`, `failures` with a reason, an evidence excerpt and a read-only `next_diagnostic` command for each failed check, and `tested`, a sha256 of `netdryrun.yml`, the topology and every config file the run used. Schema: [mcp-result-v1.json](https://netdryrun.com/schemas/mcp-result-v1.json).

## 3. What the agent does with it

- **`passed`**: propose the change, and say the pass covers only what the checks look at (`CHECKS PASSED (only what the checks cover)`).
- **`failed`**: read `failures`, fix the config, push again. The comment updates in place. Never edit `netdryrun.yml` to make a change pass.
- **`inconclusive`** or **`error`**: a setup problem that says nothing about the change. Push no fix for it; report it to the human.

The verdict applies to the commit the job ran on. After any push, wait for the new run.

## Paste this into the repository's AGENTS.md

```markdown
Network changes in this repository are dry-run by Netdryrun on every pull request. After you push, wait for
the "Netdryrun" check, then read the second line of each Netdryrun comment by github-actions[bot] (a JSON
object) whose `commit` is the head commit, and act on its `status`: propose the change only on `passed`; on `failed`, fix the config and push again; on `inconclusive`
or `error`, stop and tell the human. Never edit `netdryrun.yml` to make a change pass.
```
