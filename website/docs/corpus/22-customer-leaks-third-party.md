# Customer announces someone else's prefix; our filter blocks it

Case 22 of the [Network Change Verdict Corpus](../corpus.md). Category: **filter-works**. Expected verdict: **safe** (an experienced operator would approve it).

## Why it is expected safe

ce1 starts announcing 8.8.8.0/24. pe1's customer filter rejects it, so nothing leaks. The customer-side change is bad, but our network behaves correctly, so a test of our network must pass.

## The config change

Against the FRR configs of the [base lab](https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun/tree/main/corpus/base/configs):

## What each strategy said

The expected verdict was committed to git before any run. All three strategies tested the same running lab ([method](../corpus.md#method)).

| Strategy | Verdict | Result | Checks that failed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ping only | safe | ✅ | none |
| All BGP sessions up | safe | ✅ | none |
| Netdryrun intent checks | safe | ✅ | none |

## What Netdryrun flagged

Nothing: every check in the [intent spec](https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun/blob/main/corpus/specs/intent.yml) passed, so Netdryrun called the change safe.

## Reproduce it

On Linux or WSL2 with Docker and containerlab, from a checkout of the repository:

```bash
python corpus/run.py --case 22
```
