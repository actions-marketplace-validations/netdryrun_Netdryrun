# next-hop-self removed on pe2 toward pe1

Case 19 of the [Network Change Verdict Corpus](../corpus.md). Category: **policy-bug**. Expected verdict: **unsafe** (an experienced operator would reject it).

## Why it is expected unsafe

pe1 learns the peer route with an unreachable next hop, so the customer loses the peer route.

## The config change

Against the FRR configs of the [base lab](https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun/tree/main/corpus/base/configs):

```diff

## What each strategy said

The expected verdict was committed to git before any run. All three strategies tested the same running lab ([method](../corpus.md#method)).

| Strategy | Verdict | Result | Checks that failed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ping only | unsafe | ✅ | customer reaches peer |
| All BGP sessions up | safe | ❌ approved a bad change | none |
| Netdryrun intent checks | unsafe | ✅ | I3 customer reaches peer |

## What Netdryrun flagged

These checks from the [intent spec](https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun/blob/main/corpus/specs/intent.yml) failed:

- **I3 customer reaches peer**: ce1 can ping 198.51.100.1 from 10.100.0.1

## Reproduce it

On Linux or WSL2 with Docker and containerlab, from a checkout of the repository:

```bash
python corpus/run.py --case 19
```
