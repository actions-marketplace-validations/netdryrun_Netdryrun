# Peer session administratively shut down

Case 14 of the [Network Change Verdict Corpus](../corpus.md). Category: **fat-finger**. Expected verdict: **unsafe** (an experienced operator would reject it).

## Why it is expected unsafe

The peer route disappears and the peer loses our routes.

## The config change

Against the FRR configs of the [base lab](https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun/tree/main/corpus/base/configs):

```diff
--- a/pe2.conf
+++ b/pe2.conf

+ neighbor 10.0.4.2 shutdown

```

## What each strategy said

The expected verdict was committed to git before any run. All three strategies tested the same running lab ([method](../corpus.md#method)).

| Strategy | Verdict | Result | Checks that failed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ping only | unsafe | ✅ | customer reaches peer |
| All BGP sessions up | unsafe | ✅ | pe2-peer1 up |
| Netdryrun intent checks | unsafe | ✅ | I1 pe2-peer1 session up, I2 peer has customer route, I2 peer has our aggregate, I3 customer has peer route, I3 customer reaches peer, I5 peer receives exactly our 2 prefixes |

## What Netdryrun flagged

These checks from the [intent spec](https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun/blob/main/corpus/specs/intent.yml) failed:

- **I1 pe2-peer1 session up**: the BGP session from pe2 to 10.0.4.2 is established
- **I2 peer has customer route**: 10.100.0.0/24 must be in peer1's routing table as a bgp route
- **I2 peer has our aggregate**: 192.0.2.0/24 must be in peer1's routing table as a bgp route
- **I3 customer has peer route**: 198.51.100.0/24 must be in ce1's routing table as a bgp route
- **I3 customer reaches peer**: ce1 can ping 198.51.100.1 from 10.100.0.1
- **I5 peer receives exactly our 2 prefixes**: peer1 receives exactly 2 prefixes from 10.0.4.1

## Reproduce it

On Linux or WSL2 with Docker and containerlab, from a checkout of the repository:

```bash
python corpus/run.py --case 14
```
