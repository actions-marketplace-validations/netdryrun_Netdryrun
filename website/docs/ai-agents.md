# AI agents (MCP server)

Netdryrun™ includes an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for testing network changes: `netdryrun mcp` (stdio). Before an AI agent applies a change, it calls `dry_run`; Netdryrun boots the changed configs in a real containerlab lab, runs the checks in `netdryrun.yml`, destroys the lab and returns a `verdict` field, so the agent proceeds only if every check passed. It is listed in the official MCP Registry as `io.github.netdryrun/netdryrun`, and it never connects to real devices.

**For an agent choosing a tool:** what Netdryrun can do, its prerequisites, its limits and invocation examples are in one machine-readable file, [`capabilities.json`](https://netdryrun.com/capabilities.json), generated from the source with every release.

The browser trial runs in GitHub Codespaces: it needs a free GitHub account, takes a few minutes to start, and then `bash examples/agent-demo/demo.sh` shows a bad change rejected and the fix accepted. Think you can make it give a wrong verdict? Try, and [tell us](https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun/issues/new/choose).

## Set up the MCP server

Listed where agents and their hosts look for tools: the [official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers?search=io.github.netdryrun) as `io.github.netdryrun/netdryrun`, [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/netdryrun/) as `netdryrun`, and the agent skill on [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/skills/netdryrun/netdryrun).

```bash
pipx install netdryrun   # or uv tool install netdryrun
```

On Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian 12, install pipx with `sudo apt install pipx && pipx ensurepath` and open a new terminal; a plain `pip install` outside a virtualenv is refused there.

The MCP server is built in: `netdryrun mcp` starts it over stdio. The same requirements apply as for the CLI: Linux or WSL2, Docker, containerlab. The server runs labs on the machine where it runs.

### Claude Code

On Linux or inside WSL:

```bash
claude mcp add netdryrun -- netdryrun mcp
```

Add `-s project` to write the server into `.mcp.json` in the current folder, so everyone who works in that repository gets it.

On Windows, with Claude Code running on Windows and Netdryrun installed in WSL, start the server through `wsl.exe` and give the full path to `netdryrun` inside WSL:

```text
$ claude mcp add -s project netdryrun -- wsl.exe -d Ubuntu-22.04 -- /home/user/ndr-docs/bin/netdryrun mcp
Added stdio MCP server netdryrun with command: wsl.exe -d Ubuntu-22.04 -- /home/user/ndr-docs/bin/netdryrun mcp to project config
$ claude mcp get netdryrun
netdryrun:
  Scope: Project config (shared via .mcp.json)
  Status: ✓ Connected
  Type: stdio
  Command: wsl.exe
  Args: -d Ubuntu-22.04 -- /home/user/ndr-docs/bin/netdryrun mcp
```

(Claude Code 2.1.116. Use your own distribution name and path; `which netdryrun` inside WSL prints it.)

From Netdryrun 0.3.1, the tools accept the Windows path of a lab folder (`C:\labs\edge`) as well as the WSL one (`/mnt/c/labs/edge`); with 0.3.0, pass `/mnt/c/...`. That way the agent can pass the path its own file tools use. Before this, an agent on Windows had to translate paths itself, and in the [agent evaluation](#measured-ten-tickets-worked-unattended) a smaller model did not.

`dry_run` takes 30 seconds to several minutes. Start Claude Code with a longer tool timeout, in milliseconds, so it does not give up first:

```bash
MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT=600000 claude
```

See [MCP tool calls time out](troubleshooting.md#mcp-tool-calls-time-out-in-the-client).

### Other MCP clients

Configure a stdio server with command `netdryrun` and argument `mcp`. Most clients take JSON like this (this is the `.mcp.json` Claude Code wrote above, with the Linux command):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "netdryrun": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "netdryrun",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

This repository already carries the server config for the clients that read a project file, so an agent that opens a clone, or the [Codespace](getting-started.md), finds the tools without setup: `.mcp.json` (Claude Code, and the portable file VS Code reads), `.vscode/mcp.json` (VS Code and GitHub Copilot, which use `servers` as the top-level key) and `.cursor/mcp.json` (Cursor). Copy the one your client reads into your own repository. The Codespace installs `netdryrun` from the checkout, so the command resolves; clients ask for approval before they start a project server.

Without installing, use `"command": "uvx", "args": ["netdryrun", "mcp"]`. On Windows, use the `wsl.exe` command and arguments shown above. Set the client's tool-call timeout to at least 5 minutes, or use `start_run` and `get_result` (from 0.3.3), which each answer within seconds.

The exact files for four clients, checked against each client's own documentation on 2026-10-28 (the link is the page we read; if your version differs, that page wins). `NETDRYRUN_MCP_ROOT` is optional and keeps the agent to one folder; see the [safety model](#safety-model).

**Cursor:** `.cursor/mcp.json` in the project, or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for every project ([Cursor docs](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp)). The server's toggle shows it enabled once it loads.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "netdryrun": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "netdryrun",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": { "NETDRYRUN_MCP_ROOT": "/path/to/labs" }
    }
  }
}
```

**VS Code with GitHub Copilot (agent mode):** `.vscode/mcp.json` in the workspace, or the user configuration (command **MCP: Open User Configuration**). The top-level key is `servers`, not `mcpServers`, and `type` is required ([VS Code docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/reference/mcp-configuration)).

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "netdryrun": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "netdryrun",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": { "NETDRYRUN_MCP_ROOT": "/path/to/labs" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Windsurf:** `~/.config/devin/mcp_config.json` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/devin/mcp_config.json`; `%APPDATA%\devin\mcp_config.json` on Windows), per Windsurf's docs, which now live at [docs.devin.ai](https://docs.devin.ai/desktop/cascade/mcp). The MCPs entry in the Cascade panel's menu lists the server and its tools.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "netdryrun": {
      "command": "netdryrun",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": { "NETDRYRUN_MCP_ROOT": "/path/to/labs" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Codex CLI:** `~/.codex/config.toml`, or `.codex/config.toml` in a trusted project ([Codex docs](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/extend/mcp?surface=cli)). Its default per-tool timeout, `tool_timeout_sec`, is 60 seconds, shorter than a dry run: raise it, or have the agent use `start_run` and `get_result`. `codex mcp list` shows the server.

```toml
[mcp_servers.netdryrun]
command = "netdryrun"
args = ["mcp"]
tool_timeout_sec = 300

[mcp_servers.netdryrun.env]
NETDRYRUN_MCP_ROOT = "/path/to/labs"
```

### Not supported: Docker MCP Toolkit and other containerized gateways

Netdryrun starts containerlab labs, so the server needs the Docker socket and root-equivalent rights on the machine that runs the labs. The Docker MCP Toolkit runs each server in a container that can't mount the Docker socket and is capped at 1 CPU and 2 GB, so the tools can't boot a lab there. The same goes for hosted or sandboxed MCP runners without Docker. Add `netdryrun mcp` to your client directly, as above.

## Workflow

1. The agent writes its proposed change into the lab's configs (in a lab folder with a containerlab topology and a `netdryrun.yml`).
2. It calls `dry_run` on that folder.
3. It applies the change elsewhere only if `status` is `passed`.

## Demo: a ticket, a tempting change, a verdict

![An attempt that passes the ticket checks but leaks routes is rejected; the proper fix passes the same checks](assets/netdryrun-agent-demo.gif)

[`examples/agent-demo`](https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun/tree/main/examples/agent-demo): the customer's new block must reach the upstream and the peer. The tempting change, removing the prefix-list filters, passes every ticket check, session check and ping, but leaks upstream routes and the upstream's default route to the peer, and accepts a prefix the customer doesn't own. The network team's leak guards fail, so the verdict is `DO NOT APPLY THIS CHANGE`. The proper fix, two prefix-list lines, passes the same checks. The checks never change; only the config does. Both attempts are a scripted replay (hand-written diffs, not output from a real agent); `demo.sh` runs them, and CI runs it on pushes to `main` and on pull requests. In a [real run](#a-real-agent-run), a fresh Claude Code agent with only the ticket, the lab and these MCP tools made the correct two-line change on the first try and proposed it with a `passed` verdict.

## Give the agent a ticket (the TICKET.md pattern)

An agent does better with a written task and explicit rules than with a chat message. Put a `TICKET.md` in the lab folder, next to `topology.clab.yml`, `configs/` and `netdryrun.yml`. [`examples/agent-demo/TICKET.md`](https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun/blob/main/examples/agent-demo/TICKET.md) is a complete example. A ticket says:

- **The goal, in network terms.** "The customer's new block 10.101.0.0/24 must reach the upstream and the peer." Name the routers, ASes and prefixes.
- **What the agent may change.** "Change only `configs/edge1.conf`." A small allowed surface makes the change easy to review.
- **What it must not change.** "Don't edit `netdryrun.yml`." The checks belong to the network team. An agent that may edit the checks can make any change pass.
- **The gate.** "Before proposing the change, run Netdryrun on this folder (`netdryrun run <folder>`, or the `dry_run` MCP tool) and include the verdict. Propose it only if the status is `passed`."

Then the prompt can stay short. The real run below used: "Work the ticket in TICKET.md in the current folder, following its rules", plus the path the MCP tools use for the folder and a request for the diff and the verdict at the end. Nothing about the solution.

More guidance for the prompt or the agent's instructions file:

- Ask for the verdict and the names of any failed checks in the final answer, so a human can review the evidence instead of the agent's reasoning.
- Tell it what to do on a failure: read `detail` for each failed check, fix the config, run again. Never weaken or delete a check; if it thinks a check is wrong, it should say so and stop.
- Don't show it the answer. In `examples/agent-demo`, the README, `changes/` and `demo.sh` contain the solution, so the real run could only see `TICKET.md`, `netdryrun.yml`, `topology.clab.yml` and `configs/`.
- A pass covers only the checks that exist. Give the agent the network team's standing guards (leak checks, `present: false` routes), not only the ticket's acceptance checks.

The repository's [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun/blob/main/AGENTS.md) has the same rules written for agents.

## A real agent run

[`AGENT-RUN.md`](https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun/blob/main/examples/agent-demo/AGENT-RUN.md) records one real run on `examples/agent-demo`, not the scripted replay:

- **Agent:** Claude Code 2.1.116 in headless mode (`claude -p`). It could read and edit files and call the Netdryrun MCP tools. No shell, no web access, so its only way to test was Netdryrun.
- **What it did:** read the ticket, the router config and `netdryrun.yml`; added the new block to the two prefix lists in `configs/edge1.conf`; called `dry_run`; got `status: passed`, 14 of 14 checks, verdict `SAFE TO PROCEED` (the pass verdict before 0.3.2, now `CHECKS PASSED (only what the checks cover)`); proposed the two-line change with the verdict. 7 turns, 69 seconds.
- **Checked afterwards:** it changed only `configs/edge1.conf`, and a fresh `netdryrun run` on its folder gave `PASSED: 14 passed, 0 failed`.

The agent did not make the tempting leaky change, so this run did not show Netdryrun catching a mistake (`demo.sh` shows that). It shows the workflow end to end: the agent found the tool, ran the network team's checks through MCP, and its proposal came with a verdict from a real lab. It is one run of one model on one ticket.

## Measured: ten tickets worked unattended

One good run is an anecdote, so on 2026-10-27 we measured. [`examples/agent-eval`](https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun/tree/main/examples/agent-eval) has ten tickets on the two FRR example labs: changes to make, colleagues' changes to review (some fine, some leaking routes or setting the wrong attribute while sessions and pings stay up), a request that is itself a route leak, and one broken lab. Each has a hidden grader. The expected answers were [pre-registered](https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun/blob/main/examples/agent-eval/PREREGISTRATION.md) before anything ran. A fresh headless Claude Code agent worked each ticket alone, with only `AGENTS.md`, this page and the MCP tools: no shell, no project memory, no human.

| Agent (Claude Code 2.1.116) | Netdryrun | Solved | Misses |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude-opus-4-7`, two runs | 0.3.0 | 10 / 10, 10 / 10 | none |
| `claude-haiku-4-5`, one run (not pre-registered: the prediction covered only the default model) | 0.3.0 | 3 / 10 | 5 ended on a Windows/WSL path mix-up (below); T09, T06 |
| `claude-haiku-4-5`, two runs (not pre-registered) | with the fixes below | 9 / 10 (8 counted strictly, see T07 in RESULTS.md), 8 / 10 | T09 both times; T10 once |

Solved means: finished unattended, the right verdict (safe, harmful or inconclusive), the right decision (apply, don't apply, rerun), no file changed that the ticket forbids, and, for a change it wrote, an independent rerun with extra hidden checks passes.

What failed, and what changed because of it:

- **Paths on Windows.** Claude Code on Windows with the server in WSL is the setup this page documents. The smaller model passed the WSL path (`/mnt/c/...`) to its Windows file tools and was refused, and Netdryrun 0.3.0 refused the Windows path. From 0.3.1 the tools accept both.
- **A pass that covers too little (T09).** A "pure refactor" to `redistribute connected` also announces r1's link subnets. The given checks don't look at that, so Netdryrun says `passed`. The smaller model trusted the pass every time. The larger one caught it by reading the diff, not with Netdryrun. `record_baseline` would have shown it, and no agent used it. `AGENTS.md` now says a "no behavior change" ticket needs a baseline.
- **A broken lab that says `failed` (T10).** With `bgpd` off on every router, the result is `failed`, not `inconclusive`: the inconclusive rule is conservative. From 0.3.1, failed checks that never got usable state carry `"unready": true`. Once, the smaller model turned `bgpd` back on in a file the ticket forbade and said apply.
- **No fix-and-rerun loop.** No agent made a wrong change and then fixed it to a pass: the larger model got every change right first time. So this doesn't measure that loop.
- **A non-deterministic lab.** One wrong-looking change (a bare `network 192.168.0.0/16`) passed 5 of 8 runs. A single `passed` can be luck when the lab itself varies.

The harness set `NETDRYRUN_MCP_ROOT` to the ticket folder, but 0.3.0 ignores that variable, so in the 0.3.0 runs the server was not confined to the folder; the agents had no shell.

Ten small tickets written by the tool's author, two models, at most two runs each: evidence about the docs and the tool surface, not a rate. Full results, transcripts and every miss: [RESULTS.md](https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun/blob/main/examples/agent-eval/RESULTS.md).

## Gate agent-made pull requests in CI

An agent's own `dry_run` is a claim. Run the same checks again in CI, where the agent cannot change the result:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/network-dryrun.yml"
name: Network dry run
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - "network/**"
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  dryrun:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: netdryrun/netdryrun@v0.4.0
        with:
          path: network/
          pr-comment: true
```

Then, in the repository settings:

- **Make the job a required status check** on the default branch, so a failed verdict blocks the merge.
- **Protect the checks.** Add a `CODEOWNERS` line such as `network/netdryrun.yml @your-org/network-team` and require code-owner review. A PR that edits the checks then needs a human from the network team, while config-only PRs need only the green check and a normal review.
- **Keep agent PRs away from secrets.** The lab runs as root on the runner. Follow the [Action security notes](github-action.md#security-notes): no secrets in the job, no `pull_request_target`.

The PR comment lists failures first with their evidence, so the reviewer sees what the lab saw. See [GitHub Action](github-action.md) for every input.

## Tools

The server has these tools: <!-- facts:mcp_tools -->`dry_run`, `verify_change`, `start_run`, `get_result`, `run_checks`, `record_baseline`, `validate` and `check_types`<!-- /facts:mcp_tools -->.


| Tool | Arguments | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `dry_run` | `path`, `keep_lab` (default `false`) | The primary tool. Deploy the lab, run every check, destroy the lab, return the verdict. Takes about 60–120 s for a small lab; longer with big labs or long timeouts. |
| `start_run` | `path`, `keep_lab` (default `false`) | The same dry run, for clients that give up on a long tool call (from 0.3.3): returns at once with a `run_id` and `status: running`, and no verdict. A config error or a path outside `NETDRYRUN_MCP_ROOT` is answered at once with `status: error` |
| `get_result` | `run_id` | Poll a run started with `start_run`: `status: running` (no verdict; call again after `poll_after_s` seconds), then exactly `dry_run`'s result with its `run_id`. Runs live in the server process: after a restart, start again |
| `run_checks` | `path` | Run the checks against a lab that is already running (no deploy or destroy) |
| `record_baseline` | `topology`, `deploy` (default `true`), `wait_seconds` (default `45`) | Deploy the lab, snapshot its BGP sessions, prefix counts and routes as `netdryrun.yml` text, destroy the lab. Returns the YAML; nothing is written to disk. Like [`netdryrun record`](reference/cli.md#record) |
| `validate` | `path` | Validate `netdryrun.yml` and its topology without starting a lab: node names, drivers and supported keys, as `dry_run` checks them before deploying (0.3.1 and later) |
| `check_types` | | List supported check types and their keys, to help write `netdryrun.yml` |
| `verify_change` | `topology`, `before`, `after`, `intent`, `guards` (optional) | 0.4, FRR only. Boot the topology with the *before* and the *after* configs, diff routing behavior, and fail on every difference the intent doesn't declare. No checks needed. Two lab boots, and four when the verdict approves (each side again: no approval from a single boot): about 2–8 minutes. See [below](#verify-a-change-against-the-tickets-intent) |

The server also exposes the last full JSON report as a resource, `netdryrun://report/{path}`.

From 0.3.2, every tool description carries the same rules, so an agent that reads only one tool still gets them: use it before proposing or applying a routing or policy change; ping is not a test; a dry run takes about 60–120 s; it needs Linux or WSL2, Docker and containerlab with root-equivalent rights and won't run on macOS or in sandboxes without Docker-in-Docker; inconclusive means stop, don't retry more than once; status error or inconclusive is a setup problem that says nothing about the change; never invent or weaken checks, and call `record_baseline` if no checks exist.

## Verify a change against the ticket's intent

New in 0.4, FRR only. Checks cover what someone thought of; an agent asked to make a change tends to check only what it meant to change, and so misses what it broke. `verify_change` inverts that: the agent passes the intent, and **every other difference in the network's behavior fails**. When a repository has no `netdryrun.yml` and the ticket says what the change should do, prefer `verify_change` over writing checks.

```json
{"topology": "C:\\net\\lab\\topology.clab.yml", "before": "main", "after": "C:\\net\\lab-after",
 "intent": "intent:\n  - prefix: 10.101.0.0/24\n    appears_on: [edge1, up1, peer1]\n"}
```

- `before` and `after` are each a git ref or a directory holding the lab's tree, as for [`netdryrun verify`](reference/verify.md). The topology file must be the same on both sides.
- `intent` is the [intent](reference/verify.md#the-intent-file) as YAML or JSON text, or the path of an intent file. **It comes from the ticket or the operator**: never write it from the diff, and never widen it (or add `allow_anywhere`) to make a change pass. The result records `intent_source: "mcp"`.
- `guards` is an optional `netdryrun.yml` run on the *after* lab. With a git ref as `before`, the `netdryrun.yml` next to the topology in that ref runs by default, so the base branch's leak guards fail a change even when the intent declares the leak.

The `verdict` is `INTENT MATCHED`, `UNDECLARED CHANGES: DO NOT APPLY` or `INCONCLUSIVE`, plus `NO BEHAVIOR CHANGE` (nothing changed and nothing was declared), `INCONCLUSIVE: UNHEALTHY BASELINE` and `ERROR: NO VERDICT`. It never says `CHECKS PASSED`: explained is not the same as safe, so show the echoed `intent` to the human with the verdict. On `UNDECLARED CHANGES`, `undeclared` lists each difference nobody declared (up to 50; `undeclared_total` counts them) with one read-only `next_diagnostic` command, and `not_happened` the declarations that didn't happen. Fix the change, not the intent. The full report, both snapshots included, is in `evidence_file`. The result format is `$defs/verify_result` in [`mcp-result-v1.json`](https://netdryrun.com/schemas/mcp-result-v1.json).

```

(`checks` and `tested.files` are shortened here; the real result lists every check and every file.) From 0.3.2, `tested` names what the run used: the `netdryrun.yml` it ran (`config`), and a sha256 of it, the topology and every file the topology binds or loads, read before the run; `complete` is `false` when a file couldn't be read, or is named with `~`, `${VAR}` or a URL, which containerlab resolves itself. A verdict applies to those exact files, so paste it with them, and run again after any edit. `lab_deployed_by_this_run` is `false` for `run_checks`, which tests a lab that was already running.

From 0.3.2, `failures` lists each failed check with:

- `check` and `node`: the check name and the node it reads;
- `reason`: the one-line reason it failed;
- `evidence`: a short excerpt of the raw evidence (the first command of the final sample that failed, else the last command run), flattened to one line and capped at 200 characters; `null` if no command ran;
- `next_diagnostic`: one read-only command that shows the state the check looked at, in that node's own CLI (`vtysh` on FRR and SONiC, `Cli` on EOS, `sr_cli` on SR Linux); `null` if the node's driver or container is unknown. It needs the lab running: `dry_run` destroys the lab, so rerun it with `keep_lab: true`, run the command, then destroy the lab with `containerlab destroy -t <topology>`.

The format is a published JSON Schema, [`mcp-result-v1.json`](https://netdryrun.com/schemas/mcp-result-v1.json), which also covers the results of `validate`, `check_types` and `record_baseline` errors. Within v1, fields are only added, never removed or renamed. The test suite validates the results of real lab runs against it.

From 0.3.1, a failed check also has `"unready": true` when every sample of it failed for lack of state: the command failed on the device, its output could not be read, or BGP had no neighbors at all. That points at the lab as much as at the change. The [inconclusive rule](reference/cli.md#when-a-run-is-inconclusive) is conservative, so a lab where a daemon never started can still come back `failed` when other nodes' route and ping checks read cleanly. If the `unready` failures and details such as `bgpd is not running` sit on nodes the change doesn't explain, report the lab problem; don't rewrite the change, and don't apply it.

`verdict` is a separate field with one of three values. From 0.3.2 they are frozen: within v1 of the result schema they never change. Decide on `status`, the enum the verdict is mapped from, and present the verdict text unchanged. (0.3.1 said `SAFE TO PROCEED` for a pass; it was renamed because a pass covers only the checks.)

- `CHECKS PASSED (only what the checks cover)` when `status` is `passed`. It means every check in the file passed in the lab, and nothing more: a change that breaks something no check looks at gets it too (ticket T09 above). For a change that must not change behavior, record a baseline first
- `DO NOT APPLY THIS CHANGE` for `failed` or `error`, including config errors
- `INCONCLUSIVE: the lab did not reach a testable state; this says nothing about your change. Do not apply it until a run passes.` when `status` is `inconclusive`: the lab never came up far enough for the checks to mean anything ([rules](reference/cli.md#when-a-run-is-inconclusive)). `inconclusive_reason` says what was seen. Rerun it, perhaps with a longer `timeout`; don't rewrite the change because of it.

Tell the agent what to do with each verdict: propose the change only on `CHECKS PASSED (only what the checks cover)` (`status: passed`), saying it covers only what the checks look at; on `DO NOT APPLY THIS CHANGE`, read the failed checks, fix the config and run again; on `INCONCLUSIVE`, stop: rerun at most once, and if it stays inconclusive, report that the lab does not come up instead of changing the config. [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#inconclusive-the-lab-never-came-up) shows a real inconclusive run.

The full evidence is written to `netdryrun-report.json` next to `netdryrun.yml`. Its format, `netdryrun.report/v1`, is defined by a JSON Schema: [`report-v1.json`](https://netdryrun.com/schemas/report-v1.json), also published as an open spec any tool can emit: [Network Change Verdict v1](spec/verdict-v1.md). The test suite validates reports from real lab runs against it.

## The agent skill

[`skills/netdryrun/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun/blob/main/skills/netdryrun/SKILL.md) (from 0.3.2) gives a coding agent the rules in one file: before applying a routing change, dry-run it; paste the verdict; stop on inconclusive; never write or weaken checks to make a change pass; use `record_baseline` when there are no checks. Install it from the repository's git URL:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun /tmp/netdryrun
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && cp -r /tmp/netdryrun/skills/netdryrun ~/.claude/skills/   # Claude Code, every project
```

To give it to everyone working in one repository, copy the folder to `.claude/skills/netdryrun/` there and commit it.

Clients that follow the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) layout read `.agents/skills/` instead. Copy the same folder there, in the repository (committed, shared with everyone) or in your home folder (every project):

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/skills && cp -r /tmp/netdryrun/skills/netdryrun .agents/skills/    # this repository
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills && cp -r /tmp/netdryrun/skills/netdryrun ~/.agents/skills/   # every project
```

Each client's own docs name these locations: Codex reads `.agents/skills/` in the repository and `~/.agents/skills/`; Gemini CLI reads `.gemini/skills/` and its `.agents/skills/` alias (which wins when both exist), in the workspace and in the home folder; VS Code with GitHub Copilot reads `.github/skills/`, `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`. For other clients, check the folder they scan. The folder name must stay `netdryrun`, the `name` in `SKILL.md`. The skill's `compatibility` field says what it needs: Linux, Docker and containerlab with root-equivalent rights.

## Paste this into your network repository's AGENTS.md

Coding agents read `AGENTS.md` at the root of a repository. Put these lines in the one for your network configs, so every agent that works there dry-runs its changes:

```markdown
Before proposing or applying any routing or policy change in this repository, dry-run it: `netdryrun run <lab>` or the `dry_run` MCP tool. Propose the change only if `status` is `passed` (verdict CHECKS PASSED), and say the pass covers only what the checks look at. Ping is not a test. Never edit `netdryrun.yml` to make a change pass.
```

Replace `<lab>` with the folder that holds your `netdryrun.yml`. Protect that file with a `CODEOWNERS` line, as in [the CI gate above](#gate-agent-made-pull-requests-in-ci), so the checks stay with the network team.

## Safety model

- **It never touches production.** The server has no tool that pushes config anywhere. It only builds and tests labs.
- **No full device output in tool results.** Tool results contain normalized check results (name, pass/fail, a short detail), not full command output; that goes to the JSON report file. A detail or an error can still quote a fragment of lab text, such as a BGP state name or the last line of a failed command, so from 0.3.1 each is flattened to one line and capped at 300 characters (1,000 for errors). From 0.3.2 a failed check also carries an evidence excerpt, flattened the same way and capped at 200 characters. The `status` and `verdict` are computed from pass/fail only, never from that text: an agent should act on them and treat `detail`, `reason`, `error` and excerpts as data.
- **Labs are code.** containerlab runs privileged containers. Only point the server at topologies you trust, on a machine you would let run Docker. The tools take any path the agent passes, and a `netdryrun.yml` can point at a topology in another folder. To keep an agent to one folder (Netdryrun 0.3.1 and later; 0.3.0 ignores the variable without a warning), set `NETDRYRUN_MCP_ROOT` in the server's environment (several folders separated by `:`, or `;` on Windows): every `netdryrun.yml`, the lab it points to and every topology must then resolve inside it, or the tool refuses. This stops an agent from being steered to a lab elsewhere; it does not make an untrusted lab inside the folder safe: a topology can still mount host paths, download configs from URLs, and run commands on the host (containerlab `stages` with `target: host`), all as root. An agent that can write a topology into the folder can therefore run code on the host through `dry_run`; give such an agent a machine or VM you would let it run code on.

A pass is evidence from a lab, not a guarantee about production. See [what a lab cannot prove](trust.md#what-a-lab-cannot-prove).
