**Test network changes before they touch production.**

Netdryrun™ boots your topology as a real virtual network ([containerlab](https://containerlab.dev)), applies your configs, and checks how the network actually *behaves*: BGP sessions, prefix counts, routes, reachability. It catches mistakes like route leaks before they reach production, and leaves evidence a reviewer can trust.

```text
$ netdryrun run examples/frr-bgp-broken
Deploying lab ndr-frr-broken (3 nodes)...
  [PASS] r1: BGP session to 10.0.12.2 is established -- state is established (6.3s)
  [PASS] r1: ping 192.168.3.1 from 192.168.1.1 expects success -- 3/3 replies (2.3s)
  ... (3 more passing checks trimmed)
  [FAIL] r1: route 0.0.0.0/0 via bgp is absent -- unexpectedly present via bgp (not selected) (0.1s)
FAILED: 5 passed, 1 failed (6 checks)
```

That run caught a leaked default route that was *received but not selected*. A ping test or a config linter would have missed it.

> Status: **v0.2.0, early.** Works today with FRR, Nokia SR Linux, SONiC (docker-sonic-vs) and Arista EOS (cEOS, bring your own image) on Linux and WSL2. On the [verdict corpus](https://netdryrun.com/corpus/) (30 realistic BGP changes, expected verdicts committed before any run), Netdryrun judged 24/30 correctly, ping-only checks 20/30 and all-sessions-up checks 15/30. Feedback and issues are very welcome.
<!-- /facts:readme_status -->

## Why

- **It tests behavior, not syntax.** Linters and config diffs can't tell you whether BGP will come up or whether a prefix leaks. A real control plane can.
- **It's built for CI.** One GitHub Action, a pass/fail exit code, a Markdown summary in the job, JUnit XML, and a JSON evidence file with every command and raw output.
- **It doesn't lie about convergence.** Positive checks wait for the network to converge. Negative checks ("this route must be absent") run only after convergence and must hold for a time window, so they can't pass just because BGP hasn't come up yet.

## Quick start

Requirements: Linux or WSL2, Docker, [containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/install/), Python 3.10+.

```bash
pip install netdryrun
git clone https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun && cd netdryrun
netdryrun run examples/frr-bgp          # 3 FRR routers, should pass
netdryrun run examples/srl-frr          # SR Linux + FRR, should pass
netdryrun run examples/frr-bgp-broken   # a bad change, should fail
```

### On your own containerlab topology (3 commands)

```bash
netdryrun record my-lab/topology.clab.yml --deploy   # snapshot today's behavior into my-lab/netdryrun.yml
# ...edit your configs (the change you want to test)...
netdryrun run my-lab                                   # did anything break?
```

`record` writes a baseline of every established BGP session, prefix count and BGP route. Review it, commit it, and every future change is tested against it, locally or in CI.

## netdryrun.yml

```yaml
lab: topology.clab.yml      # your containerlab topology
timeout: 90                 # seconds a positive check may wait for convergence

checks:
  - type: bgp_session       # session reaches a state (default: established)
    node: r1
    neighbor: 10.0.12.2
  - type: bgp_prefixes      # accepted prefix count within a range
    node: r1
    neighbor: 10.0.12.2
    min: 1
    max: 10
  - type: route             # route present (or absent), optionally via a protocol
    node: r1
    prefix: 192.168.3.0/24
    protocol: bgp
  - type: ping              # reachability, optionally from a source address
    node: r1
    source: 192.168.1.1
    target: 192.168.3.1
  - type: route             # negative check: must stay absent after convergence
    node: r1
    prefix: 0.0.0.0/0
    protocol: bgp
    present: false
```

Failure scenarios take links down and check the network still behaves, then restore them:

```yaml
scenarios:
  - name: r1-r2 link fails
    link_down: {node: r1, interface: eth1}
    checks:
      - {type: ping, node: r1, source: 192.168.1.1, target: 192.168.2.1}   # rerouted via r3
      - {type: bgp_session, node: r1, neighbor: 10.0.12.2, state: down}
```

Every check also accepts `name`, `timeout` and `vrf`. Ping accepts `expect: failure` and `count`. Drivers are detected from the topology; override them with `nodes: {r1: {driver: frr}}`. Nodes that are configured after boot (SONiC) take `setup` commands: `nodes: {sonic1: {setup: [...]}}`.

| Check | FRR | SR Linux | Arista EOS (cEOS) | SONiC (VS) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `bgp_session` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `bgp_prefixes` (accepted = received minus rejected by policy) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `route` present / absent | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `ping` success / failure | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `netdryrun run [path]` | Deploy the lab, run the checks, destroy the lab. Add `--keep` to leave it up for debugging |
| `netdryrun check [path]` | Run the checks against a lab that is already running |
| `netdryrun validate [path]` | Validate `netdryrun.yml` without running anything |
| `netdryrun record topology.clab.yml` | Snapshot a known-good lab into a `netdryrun.yml` baseline, so you don't write checks by hand |

Reports: `--json FILE` (full evidence), `--markdown FILE`, `--junit FILE`. Under GitHub Actions, a summary is appended to the job page automatically. Exit codes: `0` passed, `1` a check failed, `2` config or lab error.

## GitHub Action

```yaml
name: Network dry run
on: pull_request
jobs:
  dryrun:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: netdryrun/netdryrun@v0.2.0
        with:
          path: network/        # folder containing netdryrun.yml
```

The action installs containerlab, runs the checks, uploads the JSON and JUnit reports as an artifact, and fails the job if any check fails. Outputs: `status`, `passed`, `failed`.

## For AI agents (MCP)

**AI can propose network changes. Netdryrun verifies the outcome.** Agents: read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

AI agents are starting to change networks. Netdryrun gives them a safety gate: an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets an agent dry-run its change in a real lab and proceed only if every check passes.

```bash
pip install netdryrun
```

Add it to your MCP client (for example Claude Code):

```bash
claude mcp add netdryrun -- netdryrun mcp
```

Tools: `dry_run` (deploy, check, destroy, verdict), `run_checks` (against a running lab), `validate`, `check_types`. Each result carries a separate `verdict` field: `SAFE TO PROCEED` or `DO NOT APPLY THIS CHANGE`.

**Demo** ([examples/agent-demo](examples/agent-demo)): the ticket says the customer's new block must reach the upstream and the peer. The tempting change passes every ticket check, session and ping, but leaks routes; Netdryrun rejects it. The two-line fix passes the same checks. (A scripted replay of the two attempts; CI runs it.)

<p align="center"><img alt="Attempt 1 passes the ticket checks but fails four leak guards; attempt 2 passes all 13 checks" src=".github/assets/netdryrun-agent-demo.gif" width="820"></p>

Safety model:
- The server **never touches production**. It has no tool that pushes config anywhere; it only builds and tests labs.
- Tool results contain normalized check results, not raw device output, so text inside a lab (a banner, a route description) can't inject instructions into the agent. Raw evidence goes to the JSON report file.
- A lab is code: containerlab runs privileged containers. Only point the server at topologies you trust, on a machine you'd let run Docker.

## How it compares

Netdryrun complements these tools; it doesn't replace them.

| Tool | What it does best | Where Netdryrun fits |
|---|---|---|
| [Batfish](https://batfish.org) | Static analysis of configs, without booting anything; fast and broad | Netdryrun runs the real control plane, so it sees runtime behavior: convergence, timers, what actually lands in the RIB |
| [netlab](https://netlab.tools) | Builds labs from a high-level topology, with built-in validation | Use netlab to build the lab and Netdryrun for convergence-aware CI gates and evidence reports |
| [pyATS / Genie](https://developer.cisco.com/pyats/) | A full test framework with deep Cisco parsers | Netdryrun is a small declarative YAML file plus one GitHub Action, with no test code to write |
| [containerlab](https://containerlab.dev) | Runs the lab | Netdryrun drives containerlab; it doesn't replace it |

What Netdryrun adds: positive checks wait for convergence, negative checks run only after convergence and must hold, received-but-not-selected routes count as present, and every run produces one pass/fail plus an evidence file.

## Honest limits

- Lab routers are not your production routers. A pass on FRR, SR Linux, SONiC VS or Arista cEOS is strong evidence for protocol logic and policy intent, but not proof of hardware, scale or version-specific behavior. For Arista, bring your own licensed cEOS image to test real vendor code.
- Checks cover IPv4/IPv6 unicast BGP, routes and ping, with link-down and node-isolation failure scenarios. More checks are coming: OSPF/IS-IS adjacencies, path/traceroute, policy.

## Roadmap

- **Outage replays:** famous real-world outages (route leaks, mass withdrawals) rebuilt as runnable labs and check packs. Would your change have caused one?
- More failure scenarios, more check types (OSPF/IS-IS, policy attributes, traceroute) and drivers
- PR comments with diffs, and signed evidence for change tickets
