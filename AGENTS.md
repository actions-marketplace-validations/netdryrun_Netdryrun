# Netdryrun for AI agents

If you are an AI agent (or building one) that proposes or applies network configuration changes, use Netdryrun to **verify the outcome before the change goes anywhere real**. It boots the topology in containerlab, applies the configs, waits for convergence, and checks behavior. The verdict is an external observation, not your own reasoning about the config.

## When to run it
- **Before proposing** a routing or policy change: run `netdryrun record <topology> --deploy` once to snapshot today's behavior as checks (or use the existing `netdryrun.yml`).
- **After editing configs** in the lab folder: run `netdryrun run <folder> --json report.json`.
- **Before asking a human to approve:** include the verdict and the failed checks with their evidence in your summary.

## How to read the result
| Signal | Meaning | What you should do |
|---|---|---|
| exit code `0`, `status: passed` | Every check passed after convergence | Present the change with the evidence. This proves only the checks that exist, in this lab |
| exit code `1`, `status: failed` | At least one check failed | Read `checks[].detail` and `checks[].evidence` for the failed ones, fix the config, rerun. First rule out a broken lab: the inconclusive rule is conservative, so a lab where a daemon never started can still come back `failed`. If failed checks have `unready: true` (MCP) or details like `error: ... bgpd is not running` on nodes your change doesn't explain, report the lab problem instead of rewriting the change, and don't apply it |
| exit code `2`, `status: error` | Config or lab problem (bad YAML, unknown node, lab didn't start) | Fix the setup; this says nothing about your change |
| exit code `3`, `status: inconclusive` | Checks failed, but the lab never reached a testable state: nothing passed anywhere, and the failing nodes never returned usable BGP state (CLI not answering, or no BGP neighbors at all). `inconclusive_reason` says what was seen | Rerun, perhaps with a longer `timeout`. Don't rewrite your change because of it, and don't apply it either: this says nothing about your change |

JSON report: `schema: netdryrun.report/v1`, with `status`, `inconclusive_reason` and `checks[]` of `{name, type, params, passed, detail, attempts, duration_s, history, evidence}`. Treat any status other than `passed` as "not safe to apply". JSON Schema: https://netdryrun.com/schemas/report-v1.json

A configured session that is down always counts as `failed`, never `inconclusive`: an ASN typo looks exactly like a slow lab. Exact rules: https://netdryrun.com/reference/cli/#when-a-run-is-inconclusive

## Rules
- **Never treat a pass as proof of production safety.** It covers the checks that exist, on the network OSes in the lab (<!-- facts:agents_platforms -->FRR, SR Linux, SONiC and Arista EOS<!-- /facts:agents_platforms -->), in steady state and in the defined failure scenarios.
- **Don't weaken checks to make a change pass.** If a check is wrong, say so explicitly to the human.
- Netdryrun never touches production devices. Only run topologies you were given or created in the lab folder.

## MCP
`netdryrun mcp` starts an MCP server (stdio) with the tools <!-- facts:mcp_tools -->`dry_run`, `run_checks`, `record_baseline`, `validate` and `check_types`<!-- /facts:mcp_tools -->. Each result has a separate `verdict` field: `SAFE TO PROCEED`, `DO NOT APPLY THIS CHANGE`, or `INCONCLUSIVE: the lab did not reach a testable state; this says nothing about your change. Do not apply it until a run passes.` Add it with `claude mcp add netdryrun -- netdryrun mcp`, or run it with `uvx netdryrun mcp`.
