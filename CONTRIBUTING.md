# Contributing to Netdryrun

Thanks for helping. The most valuable contributions, in order:

1. **A corpus case.** A realistic network change and its expected verdict, written *before* you run it. See [corpus/](corpus/). Cases where Netdryrun gets it wrong are especially welcome: published losses are what make the corpus trustworthy.
2. **A bug report with evidence.** Attach the JSON report (`--json report.json`); it contains every command Netdryrun ran and the raw output.
3. **A driver** for another network OS that runs in containerlab (Arista cEOS, SONiC, Juniper cRPD, and others).
4. **Docs and examples** for real-world designs.

## Development setup (Linux or WSL2, Docker, containerlab)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/netdryrun/netdryrun && cd netdryrun
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -q                     # unit tests, no lab needed
bash scripts/e2e.sh           # every example lab end to end (needs containerlab)
python corpus/run.py --case 10   # one corpus case
```

## Rules of the road

- **No false passes.** Any change to check semantics needs a test showing the case it gets right, and ideally the case it used to get wrong.
- **Real device output only.** Parser tests use output captured from live labs (`tests/fixtures/`), never hand-written JSON.
- **Keep the config format small.** New keys need a reason a network engineer would recognize.
- Commits are signed off by real people; be kind in reviews.
