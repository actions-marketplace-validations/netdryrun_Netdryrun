# Post-convergence gate (audit M3).
#
# Positive checks only prove convergence for the sessions and routes the user happened to check; a leak can
# arrive later over a session nobody checked (a slower peer, a NOS that boots later). So before the
# post-convergence phase, every node that carries a post-convergence check must report every configured
# BGP neighbor (in that check's VRF) established, with unchanged prefix counts, on 2 consecutive samples.
# Neighbors that a check expects NOT to be established (bgp_session with another state) are left out.
# Then the settle delay runs, then the hold.
#
# The wait is bounded by the largest timeout of the node's post-convergence checks. If a configured
# session on the node never comes up, its post-convergence checks fail as "not evaluated", saying which
# session (a down session is a finding, as everywhere else). A node that never answers with BGP state is
# not gated (it may not run BGP at all; its own checks show a broken node), nor is a ping-only node whose
# first answer is an error. Prefix counts that keep changing until the deadline don't block.
#
# A node that answers with no BGP neighbors at all is NOT converged: that is exactly what a node answers
# before its BGP config is applied, and a leak can arrive once it is. The gate keeps waiting up to the cap;
# if the node still reports no neighbors then (it may not run BGP), its checks go ahead, each with a
# warning in its result that it was evaluated without BGP convergence. The verdict is unchanged.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Scenario timing (audit B5).
#
# A scenario's positive checks ("the route is still there", "ping still works") are already true before
# the network notices a failure, so they must not be judged on the state from before the fault took effect.
# The rule, in order:
#   1. Before applying a link fault, find the BGP sessions that run over the links going down and are
#      established: on the faulted node (neighbors in the downed interfaces' subnets, or named after the
#      interface for unnumbered BGP) and on the far end of each link, looking through bridges (neighbors
#      whose address is one of the faulted interface's addresses). Default VRF plus the VRFs the scenario's
#      checks use.
#   2. Apply the faults, then wait until every one of those sessions is no longer established on both ends:
#      proof that the network saw the fault. The wait is bounded by the largest timeout of the scenario's
#      checks; if the fault never shows, the run stops with an error (exit 2), never a verdict on pre-fault
#      state. (BGP hold timers without BFD can take up to 180 s: raise timeout.)
#   3. Wait the settle delay (--settle), so the withdrawals propagate beyond the adjacent routers.
#   4. Positive checks must then pass on 2 consecutive samples AND keep passing for the hold window
#      (--hold, or the check's hold): a redundancy claim is about the whole failure, not one instant.
#   5. Post-convergence checks then wait for the same BGP gate as at the top level (every session on their
#      node up, except the sessions over the downed links and those a check expects down, with stable
#      prefix counts; capped at their timeout), then must hold. For inject_routes this is what shows the
#      routes spread beyond the injecting node. A peer with a long advertisement interval can still delay
#      propagation beyond the gate.
# If the BGP state (or interface addresses) needed for step 1 can't be read, the run stops with an error
# (exit 2) before any fault: "couldn't read it" is never "there are none". When the state was read and no
# BGP session runs over the downed links (static routing, a link without BGP, iBGP between
# loopbacks over an IGP), step 2 has nothing to observe; steps 3 and 4 still apply, so give such scenarios
# a settle that covers the failure detection time.
