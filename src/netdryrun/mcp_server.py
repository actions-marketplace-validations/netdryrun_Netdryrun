"""MCP server: lets AI agents dry-run a network change before applying it.

Run with `netdryrun-mcp` (stdio). Install with `pip install "netdryrun[mcp]"`.
An agent that proposes a config change calls `dry_run` on the lab that contains the change,
and only proceeds if the status is "passed". Without checks, when a ticket states what the change is
meant to do, it calls `verify_change` with that intent: every other difference fails.
