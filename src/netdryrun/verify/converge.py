"""The convergence-stable snapshot: two full snapshots `settle` seconds apart must be identical.

Identical means every item and the derived facts (prefix counts per session): every configured session
established, or stably not established, on both samples (compared as established or not, never by raw
FSM state), prefix counts stable, every route and path unchanged. A node is not ready, whatever it
repeats, while its RIB is still empty (zebra not up, interfaces not configured yet) or, when it is
expected to run BGP, while it has no BGP state at all (no session and no BGP path: bgpd answers but its
config isn't loaded yet).

Two samples `settle` apart can't see an update that arrives later than `settle`: settle must exceed the
slowest MRAI (advertisement interval) or update-delay in the lab.

A command that fails (vtysh can't reach a daemon that is still starting) is retried until the timeout;
then the snapshot is unreadable, an error (exit 2), never "nothing changed". Output that doesn't match the
schema stops at once. If the snapshots never repeat within `timeout`, the result is Inconclusive, naming
what kept moving.
