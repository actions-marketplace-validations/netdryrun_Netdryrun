"""Netdryrun's machine-readable capability statement: website/docs/capabilities.json, served at
https://netdryrun.com/capabilities.json and referenced from server.json (_meta), AGENTS.md, llms.txt and the MCP
server's instructions.

One place for what an agent (or a person choosing a tool) needs to decide: the use cases and how to invoke each,
the prerequisites, the limits, the platforms, tools, check types, verdicts and exit codes. The facts (version,
platforms, check types, MCP tools, verdict strings) are read from the source, like sync_facts.py does, so the file
can't drift: `python scripts/sync_facts.py` rewrites it and `--check` fails when it is stale.

  python scripts/capabilities.py           print the statement
