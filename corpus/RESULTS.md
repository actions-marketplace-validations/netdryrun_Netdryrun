# Verdict Corpus results

Generated 2026-10-26T21:43:03+00:00 with netdryrun 0.2.0, containerlab 0.81.1, FRR quay.io/frrouting/frr:10.4.1, commit `ec23379`. Rerun everything with `python corpus/run.py`.

**Conflict of interest:** the Netdryrun maintainers wrote this corpus and the runner. Expected verdicts were committed before any run (see the git history of `corpus/cases/`). Losses are kept and shown at the same size as the catches.

## Netdryrun's losses

- **`06-customer-adds-prefix` Customer announces a second allowed /24** (false block). Normal customer growth inside the registered range.
- **`12-ibgp-send-community-dropped` send-community removed on the pe1 to pe2 iBGP session** (false pass). A common mistake when rebuilding iBGP sessions.
- **`18-redistribute-connected` redistribute connected added on pe1** (false pass). Not covered by the intent spec, which has no check for infrastructure routes at the customer.
- **`21-customer-max-prefix-removed` Customer maximum-prefix safety limit removed** (false pass). Latent risk: no steady-state check can see it until the customer actually leaks. Catching it needs a failure-injection scenario (the customer sends many prefixes), planned for a later release.
- **`23-fat-finger-third-party-origin` pe1 accidentally originates 8.8.8.0/24** (false pass). Not covered by the intent spec, which has no check for unexpected routes at the customer.
- **`30-peer-import-filter-removed` Peer inbound filter replaced with permit-all** (false pass). Latent risk: invisible in steady state until the peer misbehaves. Needs a failure-injection scenario.

## Findings after the run

These findings came after the run. The table above is left exactly as pre-registered; nothing in `corpus/cases/` was edited.

**Case 12 was labeled wrong.** The case expected that removing `neighbor 10.0.3.2 send-community` on pe1 stops pe2 from seeing the customer community. In FRR (verified on 10.4.1) communities are sent to every neighbor by default, so deleting the explicit line is a no-op: `show running-config` no longer shows it, but pe1 still advertises `10.100.0.0/24` to pe2 with community `65000:100`, and pe2 still matches it (`show bgp ipv4 unicast community 65000:100` lists the route). Reproduce with `scripts/corpus_case12_verify.sh`. The change is actually safe, so all three strategies answered case 12 correctly. With that one label corrected the scores would be: ping only 21/30, sessions up 16/30, Netdryrun 25/30. The headline numbers stay at the pre-registered values. The mistake would have been real on platforms that do not send communities by default (Cisco IOS, for example); a vendor-specific version of this case belongs in a future corpus.

**Cases 18, 23, 21 and 30 are real misses.** 18 and 23 are gaps in the intent spec (no check for unexpected routes reaching the customer or the upstream). 21 and 30 are latent risks that no steady-state check can see; they need a failure-injection scenario where the customer or peer actually misbehaves. These stay as losses.
